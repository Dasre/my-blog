  - Containere

- Containers are usually immutable and ephemeral
  - immutable infrastructure: only re-deploy containers, never change
  - this is ideal scenario, but what about databases, or unique data ?
  - docker gives us features to ensure these separation of concerns
  - this is known as persistent data
  - two ways: volumes and bind mounts
  - volumes: make special location outside of container UFS
  - bind mounts: link container path to host path

```
